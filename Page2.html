      <h1>Digital Infrastructure and the Politics of Sight</h1>

      <p>Within politics and political activism, ‘sight’ is a pivotal first step towards problem-solving. To see is to understand, and for sight to be obscured is to create complacency through ignorance. Political scientist Timothy Pachirat offers <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm69m"> a glimpse into how sight operates within politics and the transmission of information.</a>
</p> <p>
        “The impulse to link sight and political transformation is strong. Returning to the earlier discussion of Foucault’s articulation of the link between surveillance and power, a politics of sight that seeks to subvert physical, social, linguistic, and methodological distance in order to produce social and political change might be understood as a generalized Panopticon in which the prisoners have replaced the guards in the central tower that enables them to see without limits. The overseer’s view, aimed at control and discipline, would be replaced with a view, accessible to all, aimed at transparency and transformation” (p. 242, Pachirat, 2011).
</p> <p>
This would bring us to the thought of how our lack of sight creates detriment regarding the materiality of the digital. For example, we can consider some of the injustice that goes into the needs of these materials. Within digital production and infrastructure, a resource like coltan is extremely important, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227715828_Improvisational_economies_Coltan_production_in_the_eastern_Congo"> which has a history of political violence associated with the monopolization of its mines.</a>
</p> <p>
“Citibank and other corporations have negotiated directly with the ruthless occupants of the eastern Congo, notably with the RCD, who forced people to mine and plundered their villages. In other words, our demand for this product; indeed, the entire hope, promise and success of our digital age, has occurred (as it did during the transatlantic slave trade, interestingly also with much ‘labour’ from the Congo) on the backs of somewhat discerning exploitative production and circulation systems in Africa engineered by affluent nations” (p. 42, Mantz, 2008).
