      <h1>Arguments and Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        We now have a framework for understanding the political state of the materiality of the digital, along with the social precedents set by it. The truth of the matter is that these methods of obfuscation can often be purposeful in political strategy. We have to remain vigilant, as ignorance towards the true nature of the digital, along with the consequences that may come from it directly benefit those that own its infrastructure.

       As shown by the clear obfuscation in the performative exhibitionism of data centers, it’s not just something that can be revealed singularly with a revelatory truth, because to deny complexity is just another form of obfuscation. There are plenty of savvy coders who know their tech well enough, yet nonetheless fall for cheap gimmicks and marketing hype. This ultimately contributes to a core issue of digital literacy within the public. It’s been said that coding should be learnt by most simply by virtue of its importance to current society, but that’s merely a piece of the larger political necessity. Understanding of the digital also requires an understanding of infrastructure, which can even further extend to politics. As daunting as that large of a leap may seem, I believe it’s entirely necessary.</p>
